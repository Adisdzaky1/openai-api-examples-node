## OpenAI API Demos For Node 
### Simple web server

This repository contains demos from the OpenAI Developer quickstart for the APIs in
* text generation (chat)
* prompt training (added by this author)
* functions (similar to intents)
* vision (analyze images)
* speak (STT)
* listen (TTS)
* moderation (safeguards) 


The web forms and an example of few shot prompting are added.  This is a good place to start with building for generative AI applications.  Even if you don't plan to code, understanding how generative AI works can be helpful in knowing what's possible. We are headed toward programming in human language. This is a step in that goal.
